# Getting-words-in-order-with-CNN
In this notebook we will go through basics of Convolutional neural nets for NLP. We follow the book "Natural Language Processing in Action" by H. Lane, C. Howard, H.M. Hapke  "Language’s true power isn’t in the words themselves, but in the spaces between the words, in the order and combination of words. Sometimes meaning is hidden beneath the words, in the intent and emotion that formed that particular combination of words."  Basic feedforward networks are capable of pulling patterns out of data. But, the patterns they discover are found by relating weights to pieces of the input. Nothing captures the relations of the tokens. The one of most important neural network architectures for natural language processing is convolutional neural nets. It captures the relations of the tokens spatially.
